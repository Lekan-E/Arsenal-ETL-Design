# Arsenal ETL Database Design Project using Python & SQL
### An ETL design project using Python to extract and SQL to store team and players information for Arsenal Football Club.

# Situation
As an aspiring Data Analyst, I decided to work on an ETL project on my favourite sport team, Arsenal Football Club to gain hands-on experience in Webscraping and Database Management.. The aim of this project was to gather/extract data from various websites through webscraping, then clean and write SQL queries to load players and team data into my database. Now with the accesible data, I can track the team and players performance, and build visuals to draw valuable insights and comparison between past and current players. 

# Task
The goal of this ETL project is to use Python and SQL to create a database that stores data collected and updated on a week-to-week basis from various websites via webscraping, clean and aggregate the data and load the data into SQL database, then write queries to gain valuable insights, analysis and build visualization in Tableau.

# Action
The following libraries and tools were used to achieve the ETL Process:

WEBSCRAPING
1. Selenium
2. Requests, we scrape using website APIs
3. BeautifulSoup
4. Pandas

DATA CLEANING
1. Pandas
2. Microsoft Excel

DATABASE MANAGEMENT
